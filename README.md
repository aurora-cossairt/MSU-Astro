## Understanding Energy Transfer in Plasma Turbulence

Welcome to my website! 
Please enjoy these fun visualizations that illustrate what's happening in plasma turbulence simulations.

Here is a gif showing density in an MHD simulation. The streamlines show the magnetic field lines.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aurora-cossairt/msu-astro/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
