### What is Plasma Turbulence?

Let's take it one word at a time.

**Plasma** is gas that's been broken down into positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. In our research group, we treat plasma as if it were a fluid (like water or air). We don't focus on the atomic level physics.

**Turbulence** is irregular motion of fluid particles. If you've ever flown on a plane, walked along the surf, or even stirred a cup of coffee, you've experienced turbulence. 

So, **plasma turbulence** describes irregular movement of plasma particles.

### Why do we care?

Because plasma turbulence is everywhere! The vast majority of our universe consists of plasma particles, and these particles do not like to sit still. Plasma turbulence is believed to play a key role in many interesting astrophysical phenomena, including star and galaxy formation, and cosmic ray acceleration.
